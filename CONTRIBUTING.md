## Before You Start

> **Issue first, PR second.** Every pull request must be linked to an approved issue. If you want to work on something, [open an issue](https://github.com/grimmory-tools/grimmory/issues/new) (or find an existing one) and wait for a maintainer to approve it before writing code. PRs submitted without a linked, approved issue will be closed.

This protects both your time and ours. It ensures that the work is actually wanted and that you're heading in the right direction before you invest effort.

**What will get your PR closed immediately:**
- No linked issue
- No screenshots or screen recording proving the change works
- No test output pasted in the PR
- Bulk AI-generated changes that clearly haven't been reviewed or tested
- Unsolicited refactors, cleanups, or "improvements" nobody asked for
- PRs with 1000+ changed lines (split them up)

## Where to Start

Not sure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:

- [`good first issue`](https://github.com/grimmory-tools/grimmory/labels/good%20first%20issue) - small, well-scoped tasks ideal for newcomers
- [`help wanted`](https://github.com/grimmory-tools/grimmory/labels/help%20wanted) - tasks where maintainers would appreciate a hand

## Getting Started

### Fork and Clone

First, [fork the repository](https://github.com/grimmory-tools/grimmory/fork) on GitHub, then clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/grimmory.git
cd grimmory
git remote add upstream https://github.com/grimmory-tools/grimmory.git
```

### Keep Your Fork in Sync

Before starting new work, pull the latest changes from upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout develop
git merge upstream/develop
git push origin develop
```

> **Note:** Feature work targets `develop`. `main` is reserved for stable releases and release tags.

---

## Development Setup

### Project Structure

```
grimmory/
├── frontend/                # Angular frontend (TypeScript, PrimeNG)
├── booklore-api/            # Spring Boot backend (Java 25, Gradle)
├── deploy/                  # Compose, Helm, and Podman deployment examples
├── packaging/docker/        # Container runtime assets used by the Docker build
├── dev.docker-compose.yml   # Development Docker stack
├── assets/                  # Shared assets (logos, icons)
└── local/                   # Local development helpers
```

### Preferred Command Surface

Use the root [`Justfile`](Justfile) as the primary local command surface. It wraps the commands documented below into a consistent interface for both humans and agents.

Useful starting points:

```bash
just                       # Show all root, api, and ui recipes
just check                 # Run the local verification pass
just test                  # Run backend + frontend tests
just api run               # Start the backend with the dev profile
just ui dev                # Start the frontend dev server
just dev-up                # Start the Docker dev stack
just image-build           # Build the production image locally
```

> **Tip:** Agents and automation should prefer `just` recipes when a suitable recipe exists so local workflows and documented commands stay aligned.
> **Tip:** Set `GRIMMORY_COMPOSE_FILE=/path/to/compose.yml` if you need the root `just` recipes to target a different development compose file.

### Component Guides

Use the repo-level guide for workflow, release, and PR policy, then drop into the component-specific guides when you are working inside a project:

- Backend: [booklore-api/README.md](booklore-api/README.md) and [booklore-api/CONTRIBUTING.md](booklore-api/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Frontend: [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) and [frontend/CONTRIBUTING.md](frontend/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Option 1: Docker Development Stack (Recommended)

The fastest way to get a working environment. No local toolchain required.

```bash
just dev-up
```

This starts:

| Service    | URL / Port            |
|------------|-----------------------|
| Frontend   | http://localhost:4200 |
| Backend    | http://localhost:6060 |
| MariaDB    | localhost:3366        |
| Debug port | localhost:5005        |

All ports are configurable via environment variables (`FRONTEND_PORT`, `BACKEND_PORT`, `DB_PORT`, `REMOTE_DEBUG_PORT`) in the compose file.

```bash
# To stop
just dev-down
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

For full control over each component or IDE integration (debugging, hot-reload, etc.). The detailed component-level commands now live in the API and UI subproject guides linked above.

#### Prerequisites

| Tool          | Version | Download                                     |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| Java          | 25+     | [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/)            |
| Node.js + Corepack/Yarn | 24+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)      |
| MariaDB       | 10.6+   | [mariadb.org](https://mariadb.org/download/) |
| Git           | latest  | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)         |

#### 1. Database

Start MariaDB and create the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS grimmory;
CREATE USER 'grimmory_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON grimmory.* TO 'grimmory_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

> **Tip:** You can also start just the database service with `just db-up`

#### 2. Backend

Create a dev config at `booklore-api/src/main/resources/application-dev.yml`:

```yaml
app:
  path-book: '/path/to/booklore-data/books'
  path-config: '/path/to/booklore-data/config'

spring:
  datasource:
    driver-class-name: org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
    url: jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/grimmory?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
    username: grimmory_user
    password: your_password
```

Replace the paths with actual directories on your system and ensure they exist with read/write permissions.

```bash
just api run

# Verify
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

#### 3. Frontend

```bash
just ui install
just ui dev
```

The UI will be available at http://localhost:4200 with hot-reload enabled.

## Running Tests

Always run tests before submitting a pull request.

**Frontend (Vitest):**

```bash
just ui test          # Run all tests
just ui coverage      # With coverage report (output: coverage/)
```

**Backend (JUnit + Gradle):**

```bash
just api test                                                                # Run all tests
just api test-class test_class=org.booklore.service.BookServiceTest          # Specific class
just api coverage                                                            # Coverage report
```

---

## Building the Production Docker Image

To verify your changes in an environment identical to production, build and run the full Docker image locally. The multi-stage `Dockerfile` in the project root compiles both the Angular frontend and the Spring Boot backend, so you don't need any local toolchain beyond Docker.

> **Note:** The first build downloads dependencies and caches them in Docker layers. Subsequent builds are significantly faster.

### Run

You need a MariaDB instance accessible to the container. The easiest way is to use the existing Docker Compose database from the dev stack, or bring your own:

```bash

# From the repository root
just image-build

# Start only the database from the dev stack
just db-up

# Run the production image against it, reusing the dev stack's data
just image-run
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:6060.

### Cleanup

```bash
# Stop the database service when done
just db-down

# Or stop the full stack if you started it with `just dev-up`
just dev-down
```

### Cross-platform build (optional)

If you want to test a different architecture (e.g., ARM64 on an x86 machine):

```bash
just image-build linux/arm64 grimmory:local-arm64
```

### Tips

- **Memory:** The image defaults to 60% of container RAM. Limit with `--memory=512m` or similar to simulate constrained environments.
- **Volumes:** Mount your book directories to `/books`, data/config to `/app/data`, and an optional bookdrop folder to `/bookdrop`. The example above reuses the dev stack's `shared/` folders so your existing library and covers are available.
- **Logs:** Application logs are written to stdout. Use `docker logs -f grimmory-local` to follow them.

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Create branches from `develop` using these prefixes:

| Prefix      | Use for            | Example                      |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| `feat/`     | New features       | `feat/epub-reader-support`   |
| `fix/`      | Bug fixes          | `fix/book-import-validation` |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring | `refactor/auth-flow`         |
| `docs/`     | Documentation      | `docs/update-install-guide`  |

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

### Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`

Examples:

```
feat(reader): add keyboard navigation for page turning
fix(api): resolve memory leak in book scanning service
feat(auth)!: migrate to OAuth 2.1

BREAKING CHANGE: OAuth 2.0 is no longer supported
```

PR titles targeting `develop` or `main` must use the same format. Feature work is squash-merged into `develop`, and stable releases are computed from the resulting commit history on `main`.

Release impact is derived from commit type:

- `feat` => minor release
- `fix`, `perf`, `refactor` => patch release
- `docs`, `ci`, `build`, `chore`, `test`, `style` => changelog-only unless paired with a release-triggering commit

### Workflow

1. Create a branch from `develop`
2. Make your changes in small, logical commits
3. Run both frontend and backend tests
4. Update documentation if your changes affect usage
5. Run the linter and fix any issues
6. Push to your fork and open a PR targeting `develop`

Maintainers promote cleaned `develop` history to `main` for stable releases. Do not expect a second squash step from `develop` to `main`; release automation depends on preserved conventional commit history.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Before opening your PR:

- [ ] PR is linked to an **approved** issue (PRs without a linked issue will be closed)
- [ ] All tests pass (`just test`)
- [ ] Actual test output is pasted in the PR description
- [ ] Code follows the relevant component conventions (see [booklore-api/CONTRIBUTING.md](booklore-api/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [frontend/CONTRIBUTING.md](frontend/CONTRIBUTING.md))
- [ ] No lint errors
- [ ] Branch is up-to-date with `develop`
- [ ] You ran the full stack locally and manually verified the change works
- [ ] PR description includes a screen recording or screenshots proving it works
- [ ] PR description explains *what* changed and *why*
- [ ] PR contains a single logical change (one bug fix OR one feature)
- [ ] No unrelated refactors, style changes, or "improvements" are bundled in
- [ ] **PR is reasonably sized.** PRs with 1000+ changed lines will be closed without review. Break large changes into small, focused PRs.
- [ ] **For user-facing features:** include the required docs updates in this repo or in the active Grimmory docs surface

> When you open your PR on GitHub, a **PR template** will appear. Fill it out completely, including test output and screenshots.

### AI-Assisted Contributions

Contributions using AI tools (Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) are welcome, but the quality bar is the same as human-written code. **If you ship it, you own it.**

We've seen a sharp increase in AI-generated PRs where the contributor clearly never ran the code, didn't test it, and can't explain what it does. These waste maintainer time and will be closed on sight.

**If you use AI to help write code, you must still:**

- **Run the code yourself.** Build the project, start the full stack, and manually verify the change works. Trusting the AI's output without running it is not acceptable.
- **Review every line.** You must be able to explain any part of your change during review. If asked "why did you do X?" and your answer is "the AI suggested it," the PR will be closed.
- **Keep PRs focused.** One feature, one fix, or one refactor per PR. Do not submit a dump of everything the AI suggested.
- **Scrutinize AI-generated tests.** They often pass trivially without asserting anything meaningful. Tests that don't validate real behavior will be rejected.
- **Clean up.** Remove dead code, placeholder comments, empty catch blocks, and unnecessary boilerplate.
- **Stay in scope.** Do not submit refactors, style changes, or "improvements" the AI suggested that are outside the scope of the linked issue.
