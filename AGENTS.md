# Repository Guidelines

## Agent Workflow

- Start from the root `Justfile` unless you have a clear reason to drop into a subproject.
- Prefer `just api ...` and `just ui ...` over ad hoc commands.
- Keep changes scoped to the relevant project instead of mixing backend, frontend, deployment, and release edits in one pass.
- Target `develop`, not `main`.
- First prove the change with targeted tests around the edited surface, then run the wider suite for that surface before handing off.
- If you cannot run the wider suite, say exactly what you ran, what you skipped, and why.

## Project Structure

- **Backend (`backend/`)**
  - Application code: `src/main/java`
  - Resources and Flyway migrations: `src/main/resources`
  - Tests: `src/test/java`
- **Frontend (`frontend/`)**
  - Application code: `src/app/{core,features,shared}`
  - Translations: `src/i18n/`
  - Assets: `src/assets/`

## Ownership Boundaries

- `deploy/`, `packaging/`, `tools/`, `docs/`, and `assets/` are support surfaces. Do not change them unless the task actually touches deployment, packaging, release automation, or shared docs/assets.
- Keep backend, frontend, deployment, and release work separated unless the task genuinely crosses those boundaries.
- When a change spans multiple surfaces, validate each one explicitly.

## Command Surface

Use these first:

```bash
just check          # run backend + frontend verification
just test           # run backend + frontend tests
just api run        # start Spring Boot with the dev profile
just api test       # run backend tests
just ui dev         # start the Angular dev server
just ui check       # run frontend verification
```

## Backend Rules

- Use 4-space indentation and match surrounding Java style.
- Prefer constructor injection via Lombok patterns already used in the codebase. Do not introduce `@Autowired` field injection.
- Use MapStruct for entity/DTO mapping.
- Keep JPA entities on the `*Entity` suffix.
- Add Flyway migrations as new files named `V<number>__<Description>.sql`.
- Do not edit released migrations in place.
- Prefer focused unit tests; use `@SpringBootTest` only when the Spring context is required.

## Frontend Rules

- Use 2-space indentation in TypeScript, HTML, and SCSS.
- Keep Angular code on standalone components. Do not add NgModules.
- Prefer `inject()` over constructor injection.
- Follow `frontend/eslint.config.js`: component selectors use `app-*`, directive selectors use `app*`, and `any` is disallowed.
- Put user-facing strings in Transloco files under `frontend/src/i18n/`.
- Keep responsive behavior intact.
- Use Vitest for tests.

## Validation

- Use staged verification: prove the behavior locally with targeted tests first, then run the wider suite for that surface.
- Typical backend path: `just api test` and then `just api check`.
- Typical frontend path: targeted Vitest coverage for the changed area and then `just ui check`.
- If the change crosses frontend and backend boundaries, finish with a repo-level pass such as `just test` or `just check`.
- Do not claim completion from a narrow test when a broader runnable suite exists.

## PR Expectations

- If UI behavior changes, capture screenshots or a short recording for the PR.
- PRs in this repo are expected to link an approved issue and include local test output.
- Follow Conventional Commits with scopes, for example `feat(devex): ...` or `fix(entrypoint): ...`.
